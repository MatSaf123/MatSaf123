My name is Mateusz, I'm from Poland 🇵🇱 and I'm a software engineer at [Revolve Healthcare](https://revolve.healthcare/). 

My main programming langaues of choice are TypeScript, JavaScript, Python and SQL 🛠

I work with technologies such as [React](https://react.dev/), [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/), [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). One day I'll probably learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and then start convincing everyone around to also learn it.

I also like to periodically spend my weekend fixing my [neovim](https://neovim.io/) setup only for it to break a couple of weeks later 😸
