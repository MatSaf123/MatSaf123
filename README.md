My name is Mateusz, I'm from Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± and I'm a software developer at [Revolve Healthcare](https://revolve.healthcare/) specializing in web applications.

My main programming langaues of choice are TypeScript, JavaScript, Python and SQL ðŸ› 

I work with technologies such as [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [React](https://react.dev/), [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/), [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). One day I'll probably learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and then start convincing everyone around to also learn it.

I also like to periodically spend my weekend fixing my [neovim](https://neovim.io/) setup only for it to break a couple of weeks later ðŸ˜¸
